# GenShare
# This website in it's current form represents the concept of GenShare. It is currently missing some features and
does not have a functional database for publication.



# 1 - intropage.html should be the starting page when navigating the website. Press on the "Find out" button to continue to home page
# 2 - From home page, you can press "About Us" to learn about the goal of this project before continuing.
# 3 - From the home page, seniors can click "Teach" to insert information about themselves to get started with their teaching event.
# 4 - People can also click "Learn" to see what events are currently being hosted by seniors.
# 5 - If "Teach" is selected, you will be presented with a form to create a teaching event.
# 6 - If "Learn" is selected, you will be presented with categories of interests which lead to available events.

#In the teach forms, they currently do not store any data. We were not able to create a database where it can store data. The form does 
not do anything and is purely visual.
# In the "Learn" page with categories, only the first two categories have example placeholder events that represent what an event listing 
would look like. These two working categories are the "Art" and "Culinary" categories.
