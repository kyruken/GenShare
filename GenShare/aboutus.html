    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>As we age into our senior years, we often naturally find ourselves with less social interactions which can lead to loneliness in the long-term.
</p>

<p> Studies show that loneliness in seniors lead to health-related illnesses including risk mortality, depression, cognitive decline, dementia, high blood pressure, and a number of other conditions.
</p>

<p> Our goal is to reduce the loneliness that seniors experience by connecting seniors and their experiences - from recreational skills to professional experience - with a world of people eager to learn.
